# telepresence-actions

Telepresence combined with GitHub Actions allows you to run integration tests in your CI pipeline without having to run any dependant service. By connecting to the target Kubernetes cluster, intercepting traffic to the remote service and sending it to an instance of the service running in CI you will be able to test bugfixes, updates and features very easily.

## v1.0.0

The v1.0.0 of Telepresence GitHub Actions contains individual actions to:

1. [Install](./install) the Telepresence binary in the Github runner.
1. [Helm](./helm) install the telepresence traffic manager in the cluster.
1. [Connect](./connect) to a remote Kubernetes cluster.
1. [Log into Ambassador](./login) and create a [personal intercept](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/telepresence/latest/concepts/intercepts/#personal-intercept).
1. [Intercept](./intercept) traffic of service running in the K8s cluster and redirect it a service instance running in CI.

See the [Telepresence GitHub actions documentation page](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/telepresence/latest/ci/github-actions/) for information about how to use these actions and build an integration tests workflow for your repository.
**Note**: The version v1.0.0 only supports Ubuntu runners at moment.

## Usage
### Prerequisites
Get a free Ambassador Cloud account. Register [here](https://app.getambassador.io/auth/realms/production/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=telepresence-github-actions&response_type=code&code_challenge=qhXI67CwarbmH-pqjDIV1ZE6kqggBKvGfs69cxst43w&code_challenge_method=S256&redirect_uri=https://app.getambassador.io) to get a free account. No credit card required.

### Steps
The following is an example of a workflow that:

1. Checks out the repository code.
1. Has a placeholder step to run a service during CI.
1. Creates the /opt/kubeconfig file with the contents of the secrets.KUBECONFIG_FILE to make it available for Telepresence.
1. Installs Telepresence.
1. Runs Telepresence Connect.
1. Logs into Ambassador Telepresence.
1. Intercepts traffic to the service running in the remote cluster.
1. A placeholder for an action that would run integration tests, like making HTTP requests to your running service and verify it works while dependant services run in the remote cluster.
