# Telepresence intercept action

Telepresence intercept allows you to intercept only some of the traffic to a service running in a remote cluster while not interfering with the rest of the traffic. This allows you to share a cluster with others on your team without interfering with their work. See [this page](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/telepresence/latest/concepts/intercepts/?intercept=personal#personal-intercept) for more information.
